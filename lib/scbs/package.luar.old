// Finding packages.
// Should include default finder for libraries like libluarjit-5.1.so.2 with such API:

// and adapters to do search of packages custom versioning systems, custom system libpaths, custom dll name formats etc.

Package is a set of executables, libraries and/or other stuff. Each package has its name, unique to luascbs.
So, a name for any package that contains 1 single library should be prefixed with 'lib'.
A library is a set of headers and/or compilable sources and/or binaries (shared/static objects) and/or scripts.
Also may include documentation, makefiles and other utility.

For example:

libglfw-bin (version is not a part of name) consists of:
- libglfw-headers
- libglfw-bin-nh [no headers]
- an adapter stating paths of these libs and headers (project.lua)

libglfw consists of:
- headers+sources, because libglfw-headers may have changed layout of files
- an adapter to build it with luascbs (project.lua)

luajit-bin consists of:
- libluajit-bin-nh
- luajit executable (dynamically linked)

Note that any package without 'lib' suffix should not have headers or importable scripts by default (or by 100%).

luajit-bin-ns (read as 'not shared'):
- luajit executable (static linkage)

A package with suffix -bin also may be statically linked. And -ns packages may be really useless...

libluajit-bin:
- libluajit-headers
- libluajit-bin-nh

libluajit-src:
- headers+sources
- adapter

Due to that, a package/library name should be easily retrieved by executing the project.lua file during search of packages,
including names of all subpackages if some package provides more than one.
